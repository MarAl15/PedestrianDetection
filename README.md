# Pedestrian Detection

Pedestrian detection is performed based on the implemented **HOG** (Histogram of Oriented Gradients) descriptor, which extracts features from different images or sub-images of the pre-set size. An **SVM** (Support Vector Machine) classifier is then trained to determine (with a certain probability) whether or not a pedestrian appears in a given image.
